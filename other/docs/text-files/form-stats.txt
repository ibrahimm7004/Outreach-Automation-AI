Issues:
- Need to handle dropdowns and checkboxes (checkbox example: https://www.thewhomegroup.com/blog/category/press-1/, https://whatsupmag.com/weddings/advertise, https://www.arcadepunks.com/contact-arcade-punk/)
- Handle JS required fields
- Need to handle captcha 
- maybe we should add condition in unreq textarea to also check text tag (i.e. if text OR textarea exist then skip)

- Detecting a subscribe form and not even extracting the fields:

- Detecting irrelevant form: https://www.law-help.com/contact-us/
- Not extracting the displayed text on page to store to field data:

- in the cases where it's hard to detect required fields, we can also just move ahead with form filling and if error then re-loop back and fill all fields- however this means changing flow to temporarily store all fields
- detecting listing forms as well, that allow you to advertise in the form and pay right then, e.g. https://www.sunraysiadaily.com.au/classified-create
- submit button not detected: https://www.treadmagazine.com/advertise/
- sponsorship form being detected: https://www.visitannapolis.org/about-us/marketing-sponsorship-application/
