** maybe a condition needs to be added in the unrequired textarea block to also check if it contains the term 'message' anywhere before adding- 
do this in case a lot of faulty unrequired textareas are added.

need to detect dropdowns and radio buttons

basically if (unrequired and not textarea) OR (unrequired and not input) then no worries

- dont store 'hidden' OR style = display None (OR invisible?)
- dont store 'unrequired' BUT before implementing this, check:
	if our dict/list (before storing to json log) contains at least 1 textarea (or input text?). 
		If it does not then go back through the tags and check for any unrequired textareas:
			IF theyre > 1:
				create a dict of those and pass to gpt, asking return of index of most likely					store gpts chosen one to the dict/list as well
			IF theyre = 1:
				store gpts chosen one to the dict/list as well
			else (0):
				just pass the original dict/list without making changes
